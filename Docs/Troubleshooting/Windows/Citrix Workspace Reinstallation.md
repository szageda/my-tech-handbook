## 1. Description

Reinstallation of Citrix Workspace app is sometimes necessary to diagnose or resolve client-side issues. Follow these instructions if you are unable to uninstall Citrix Workspace app via *Windows Settings* -> *Installed apps*\* or *Control Panel* -> *Programs & Features*\**.

\* *Uninstall* button is greyed out (disabled).

## 2. Solution

1. **Uninstall the software using the commandline:**

    1. Run PowerShell as Administrator.

    2. Navigate to the Citrix Workspace app installation folder: `cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Citrix Workspace 2402'`

> [!NOTE]
> Replace the version number (2402) with the installed version number.

    3. Run the installer with the uninstallation switch: `.\CWAInstaller.exe /Uninstall`
    4. Wait for the uninstallation to finish.

2. **Remove residual Citrix data folders** by deleting:

3. **Reboot** the computer.

4. **Download & install the latest Citrix Workspace version** from https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/

> [!TIP]
> Consult the documentation of your organization or environment on the recommended release. I personally recommend installing either *Workspace app for Windows Current Release* or *Workspace app for Windows Long Term Service Release*.

5. **Follow the installation instructions.**

> [!NOTE]
> The installation wizard will ask which add-on(s) to install â€“ consult the documentation of your organization or environment on the recommended selection(s). If you are not sure, leave all options unselected.
