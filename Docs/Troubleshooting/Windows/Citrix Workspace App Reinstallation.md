# Citrix Workspace App Reinstallation

## 1. Description

Reinstallation of Citrix Workspace app is sometimes necessary to diagnose or resolve client-side issues. Follow these instructions if you are unable to uninstall Citrix Workspace app via *Windows Settings* -> *Installed apps*<b>*</b> or *Control Panel* -> *Programs & Features*<b>**</b>.

<b>*</b> *Uninstall* button is greyed out (disabled).  
<b>**</b> *Uninstall* button is missing.

## 2. Information

Consult the documentation of your organization or environment on the recommended release. I personally recommend installing either *Workspace app for Windows Current Release* or *Workspace app for Windows Long Term Service Release*.

The installation wizard will ask which add-on(s) to install â€“ consult the documentation of your organization or environment on the recommended selection(s). If you are not sure, leave all options unselected.
